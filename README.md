## Conventions

Parsed and html-ized versions of these transcripts live on [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com) alongside their respective episode, which is accomplished by following this naming convention:

`[podcast-slug]/[hyphenized-podcast-name]-[episode-slug].md`

For example, the episode that lives at:

`https://changelog.com/rfc/13`

Has its transcript in this repo at:

`rfc/request-for-commits-13.md`
