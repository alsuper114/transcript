# Changelog Transcripts

The repository of [Changelog](https://changelog.com) episode transcripts in Markdown format.

## Conventions

Parsed and html-ized versions of these transcripts live on [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com) alongside their respective episode, which is accomplished by following this naming convention:

`[podcast-slug]/[hyphenized-podcast-name]-[episode-slug].md`

For example, [the episode that lives at](https://changelog.com/rfc/13): `https://changelog.com/rfc/13`

Has [its transcript in this repo at](https://github.com/thechangelog/transcripts/rfc/request-for-commits-13.md): `rfc/request-for-commits-13.md`
